# Customize the Edit Dialog Using Templates in Blazor Data Grid

## Overview

This sample demonstrates how to customize the edit dialog of the Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid by using dialog templates and embedding multiple editor components within the editing form. The implementation uses custom editors such as TextBox, NumericTextBox, AutoComplete, DatePicker, and DropDownList inside the dialog template to provide a tailored data-entry experience. The grid displays order data through an `OrderDetails` model and supports dialog-based record editing. An action handler is also used to detect add operations and dynamically adjust dialog behavior when creating new records.

## Key Features

- Uses the Syncfusion Blazor DataGrid with dialog-based editing.
- Customizes the edit dialog through a template instead of the default editor layout.
- Integrates Syncfusion `TextBox` components for text input fields.
- Integrates Syncfusion `NumericTextBox` components for numeric fields.
- Integrates Syncfusion `AutoComplete` components for assisted text selection.
- Integrates Syncfusion `DatePicker` components for date editing.
- Integrates Syncfusion `DropDownList` components for predefined selections.
- Uses an `OrderDetails` data model containing fields such as `OrderID`, `CustomerID`, `Freight`, `ShipCity`, `OrderDate`, `ShipName`, `ShipCountry`, and `ShipAddress`.
- Maintains editable order records using an in-memory `List<OrderDetails>` collection.
- Implements `OnActionBeginHandler(ActionEventArgs args)` to identify add operations and update the `IsAddNew` state when `RequestType` equals `Action.Add`. 【2-671b11】
